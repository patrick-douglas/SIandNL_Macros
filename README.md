#### Stereology and Three-dimensional reconstruction Excel tools
Hello everyone, today I will present a VBA code to help stereologists process their data from Stereoinvestigator and Neurolucida software.

#### 1 - Create a summary table from [Optical fractiotator probe](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/help/si11/Content/SI_SPECIFIC/Probes/Optical_Fractionator.htm) from [StereoInvestigator](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/stereo-investigator)
First we need to download the .xlsm file called [(PLANILHA_RESUMO_SI.xlsm)](https://github.com/patrick-douglas/SIandNL_Macros/blob/master/PLANILHA_RESUMO_SI.xlsm) from the git-hub page, after download open the file in the Microsoft Excel (2016/2019 is preferred)
